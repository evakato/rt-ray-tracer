This project is a basic ray tracer that implemented multiple acceleration structions. You can also observe the performance of these tracing method during runtime, changing viewpoints and tracing methods.

Changing scene during runtime is currently not valid.

Change the Scene could be done by modifying the variable "SCENE_CODE" in rederer.h. Set it to "1" for the random triangle scene and "2" for reading the unity.tri and "3" for the Broken_screen scene.

Change viewpoint by using num button, 1: TopDown, 2: Left, 3: Front

Change Ray-Tracing Method During Runtime: K for KDTREE, B for BVH, G for GRID.
